# Animals Affect: Can you read sheep facial expressions? We build algorithms that can!

" Animals in pain do show reliable, if at times, very subtle signs of distress. A recently developed Sheep Pain Facial Expression Scale (SPFES) can help handlers accurately and objectively determine the degree of pain an animal is experiencing." Can you identify the signs?

## How to play
The objective of the game is to classify sheep facial expressions as happy ("no pain") or sad ("pain").

## Data
The data will be saved in the Data folder in the format `data_<day>_<hour>_<minutes>_<seconds>.csv`
